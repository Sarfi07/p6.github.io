        <h3>PRIVATISATION</h3>
        <pr>Privatization is the process of transferring an enterprise or industry from the public sector to the private
            sector. The public sector is the part of the economic system that is run by government agencies.In 1991 India
            made some major policy changes in their economic ideologies. There were stagnation and slow growth in the
            economy.
    
            To tackle these problems, then the Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh introduced some major economic reforms.
            Now, we call it the liberalization of the Indian Economy and the LPG reforms.
    
            Privatization has a very broad meaning in economics. Everything that ranges from the introduction of private
            capital to selling government-owned assets to transitioning to a private economy.<br><hr>
